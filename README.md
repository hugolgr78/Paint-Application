# Paint-Application

This project was developed solely in **Python** using the **customtkinter** library and was the first I've made. It's a simple paint application inspired by classic paint apps such as **Microsoft Paint**. It provides an intuitive and customizable drawing experience.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
- 🖌️ **Brush Tool**: Draw on the canvas using an adjustable brush size.  
- 🧹 **Eraser Tool**: Erase parts of your artwork with an adjustable eraser and undo any previous actions.  
- 🎨 **Color Selection**: Choose from a wide range of colors, or customize your brush color using **RGB values** or a **color wheel**.  
- ✏️ **Shapes**: Add various shapes (e.g., circles, squares) to your canvas for more creative options.  
- 🖼️ **Canvas Color**: Change the background color of the canvas with the same flexibility as the brush tool.  
- 💾 **Save Function**: Save your artwork as an image on your PC for later use or sharing.  

This simple yet effective paint app gives users the flexibility to create drawings and designs with various tools, making it an ideal project for learning how to build graphical user interfaces in Python.
